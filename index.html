        <h3> Why do we do what we do?</h3>
          <p> All across the cinematic universe, there are characters that make us feel any symblance of connection, or representation.
        A number of these characters, however go underrepresented; whether it be because they make some simpleton feel icky , or maybe
        they have killed thousands in an emotional outburst, It's come to me that a majority of these misundrstood characters are WOMEN. 
          </p>
        <h3> Entertainment Hates Women</h3>
        <p> This is the very unfortunate truth if Hollywood. Built on the foundation of making women suffer for content.</p>
